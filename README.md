# SeeNet
Self-Erasing Network for Integral Object Attention in NeurIPS2018


### Network architecture and more details
Please refer to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.09821.pdf).

### Usage
Please install [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) first. I think you may find a great number of tutorials talking about how to install it.
```bash
cd <caffe_root>/examples
git clone https://github.com/Andrew-Qibin/SeeNet.git

ipython notebook vis.ipynb
```
Before you start, you also need our [pretrained model (google drive)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zMGgStdf8AucFmbHlxDI2Fqxlu6t8GIG).
